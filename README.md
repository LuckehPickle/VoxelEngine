An open source video game engine by the UON Social Coding group! VoxelEngine is written in Kotlin, and uses Gradle for building, testing, and generating documentation.

## What is VoxelEngine?

VoxelEngine (work in progress title) is a group project designed to teach members of the UON Social Coding group the skills required to work on a large scale group project. Along the way we will face a number of challenges, which we have split into various milestones.

 1. Graphics
 2. Terrain generation
 3. Physics
 4. Texturing
 5. Sounds
